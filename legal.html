  <h3 id="no-unlawful">NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE</h3>
  <p>As a condition of your use of the Jamba Online Services, you warrant to Jamba that you will not use the Jamba
    Online Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices. You may not

  <h3 id="registration">REGISTRATION</h3>
  <p>You need not register with Jamba to simply visit and view the Sites or App and use many of the Services available
    on the Sites or App. However, Jamba may from time to time require you to register for an account in order to access
    certain password-restricted areas of the Sites and Apps and to use certain Services and materials offered on and
    through the Sites and Apps, including, without limitation, the My Jamba Rewards program. The decision to provide
    this information is purely voluntary and optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may
    not be able to access certain content or participate in certain parts or features of the Sites and Apps, including,
    without limitation, the My Jamba Rewards program. You agree that you will not provide any false personal information
    to the Sites or Apps or create an account for anyone other than yourself without their permission. You will also not
    create more than one personal profile. If you select a username for your account, you will not incorporate any
    third-party intellectual property into your username, and we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe
    in our sole discretion that is necessary or appropriate (such as if a celebrity or trademark owner complains about a
    username). Jamba shall have the right to approve or reject any requested account, in Jamba’s discretion. If your
    account is approved, you will be permitted to log in to the applicable Site, App or Service using the password you
    select. You may not permit anyone other than yourself to use your username or password to gain access to the Site,
    App or Service. You will take reasonable steps to maintain the privacy of your username and password and to prevent
    unauthorized access to or disclosure of your username and password. You are responsible for all activities that
    occur using your username and password. </p>

  <p>The Sites and Apps may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, guest
    satisfaction surveys, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed
    to
    enable you to communicate with Jamba, the public at large, or within a group (collectively,
    "<strong>Communication
      Services</strong>"). As used in these Terms of Use, the term Jamba Online Services shall include
    Communication
    Services. You
    agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send, and receive messages and material that are proper
    and
    related to the particular Communication Service.</p>
  <p>All remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, discussions, chats, postings, transmissions, bulletin boards, or other
    information communicated to Jamba through the Sites and Apps, via the Communication Services or otherwise (each,
    a
    "<strong>Submission</strong>"), will forever be the property of Jamba, except as otherwise expressly stated by Jamba
    in connection with a specific Submission. Jamba will treat any Submission as nonproprietary and non-confidential. By
    posting, uploading, inputting, providing, or submitting your Submission you acknowledge that you and not Jamba have
    full responsibility for the message, including its legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality, and
    copyright. You further warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission
    as described in this section including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post,
    upload, input, or submit the Submissions. Except as otherwise expressly stated by Jamba in connection with a
    specific Submission, anything you transmit or post becomes the property of Jamba and may be used for any purpose,
    including, but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast, posting, or
    marketing. </p>
  <p>No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission, as provided herein. Jamba is under no
    obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and may, in Jamba sole discretion, remove any Submission at
    any time, for any reason, without notice to you. </p>
  <p>Jamba may from time to time monitor Submissions on the Sites, Apps and Communication Services; however, Jamba is
    under no obligation to do so. Jamba assumes no responsibility or liability arising from the content of any such
    Submissions, nor for any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission, falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity,
    danger, or inaccuracy contained in any information within such locations on the Sites or Apps, including in
    Submissions. You are strictly prohibited from posting or transmitting any unlawful, threatening, libelous,
    defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane material or any material that could
    constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or
    otherwise violate any law. Jamba will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting
    or directing Jamba to disclose the identity of anyone posting any such information or materials. </p>
  <p>When using the Jamba Online Services and/or making a Submission, you agree to abide by common standards of decency
    and act in accordance with the law. By way of example and not limitation, you agree not to: </p>
  <p>
  </p>

    <li>Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten, or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and
      publicity) of others.</li>

      obscene,

    <li>Upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights
      of
      privacy of publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.
    </li>
    <li>Upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may
      damage
      the operation of the Jamba Online Services, or another's computer.</li>
    <li>Advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose, unless such Site, App, or
      Service specifically allows such messages.</li>
    <li>Conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes, or chain letters.</li>
    <li>Download any file posted by another user of a Site, App, or Service that you know, or reasonably should
      know,
      cannot be legally distributed in such manner.</li>
    <li>Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices, or proprietary designations or
      labels
      of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded.</li>
    <li>Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Sites, Apps, and Services, or any part

  <p>Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children on or
    through the Jamba Online Services. Jamba does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in

    Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not
    authorized Jamba spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Jamba. </p>
  <p>Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction, and/or
    dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you download the materials.</p>

  <h2 class="h3-like" id="dispute-resolution">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Application.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or
    establishment is the
    United States. If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless
    attempt
    to bring any legal claim against Jamba in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for
    determination
    of the threshold issue of whether this “Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver”
    section
    (“<strong>Dispute Resolution Section</strong>”) applies to you, and all other threshold determinations,
    including residency,
    arbitrability, venue, and applicable law. <br />
    <strong>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process.</strong> Jamba is committed to participating in a
    consumer-friendly dispute
    resolution process. To that end, these Terms of Use provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom
    this
    Dispute Resolution Section applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Jamba (described in the
    “Mandatory
    Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification” section below), and if necessary, (2) a binding
    arbitration
    administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”). You and Jamba each retain the
    right to seek relief in
    small claims court as an alternative to arbitration. <br />
    <strong>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification.</strong> At least 45 days prior to
    initiating an arbitration,
    you and Jamba each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to
    negotiate
    an informal resolution. You must send your notice of dispute to Jamba by emailing it to <a href="mailto:privacy@jamba.com">privacy@jamba.com</a>. Jamba
    will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Jamba account, if any. A notice of
    dispute
    must include: the party’s name, preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the
    relief
    sought. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 45-day period, only then may either
    party
    commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a a="" class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>) with the AAA and
    providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at <a a="" class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>
    ).<br />
    <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Jamba mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
      or relating to these Terms of Use or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or
      interpretation thereof, or any use of the Jamba Online Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by
      binding individual arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration
      Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Jamba agree that the arbitrator will decide that
      issue. </strong><br />
    <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You and Jamba each agree that the following causes of action
    and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in
    a court of competent jurisdiction (as set forth in the “Governing Law and Venue” section below): (i) any claim or
    cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
    trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking
    emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking,
    cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief. You and Jamba agree that the remedy of
    public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action,
    and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.<br />
    <strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in
    interstate commerce and
    the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this
    provision.
    The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other
    AAA
    arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect,
    except as modified here.
    The AAA Rules are available at <a a="" class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. In order to initiate
    arbitration,
    a completed written demand (available
    at <a a="" class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> ) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other
    party,
    as specified in the AAA rules.<br />
    <strong>Modification to AAA Rules – Arbitration Hearing/Location.</strong> In order to make the arbitration
    most
    convenient to you,
    Jamba agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S. county
    where
    you reside; (b) in Atlanta, Georgia; (c) via phone or video conference; or (d) if all parties agree, by
    solely
    the
    submission of documents to the arbitrator.<br />
    <strong>Modification of AAA Rules – Attorney’s Fees and Costs.</strong> Your arbitration fees and your share
    of
    arbitrator
    compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
    If
    such
    costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Jamba will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
    Either
    party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other
    party
    has
    asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the
    purpose
    of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.<br />
    <strong>Arbitrator’s Decision.</strong> The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
    conclusions upon which the
    arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper
    jurisdiction.
    The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief
    may be
    awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
    claimant’s
    individual claim.<br />
    <strong>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings.</strong> You and Jamba acknowledge and agree that,
    to
    the fullest extent
    permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
    purported
    class
    action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or
    consolidated
    proceeding. Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and
    may
    not
    otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial
    determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any
    claim,
    cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that
    claim,
    cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in
    a
    court
    of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed
    pursuant to
    this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not
    subject
    to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are
    resolved
    by
    the arbitrator.<br />
    <strong>Severability.</strong> Except as provided in the “No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings”
    section above, in the event
    that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be
    severed
    and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.<br />
    <strong> Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> If Jamba changes this Dispute Resolution Section after
    the
    date you last accepted
    these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject that change by
    sending
    us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new
    change,
    however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute
    between
    you
    and Jamba (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and
    enforceable
    as
    to any Dispute between you and Jamba.<br />
    <strong>Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to opt-out of
    the
    Arbitration Agreement
    (“<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>”). The Opt-Out Notice must be received within 30 days after the date you
    accept these Terms of Use
    for the first time (the “<strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>”). In order to opt-out, you must mail (1) your
    full
    name; (2) your address
    (including street address, city, state, and zip/postal code); (3) the email address(es) associated with your
    Jamba
    account, if any; and (4) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Jamba through
    arbitration.
    This
    procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Any opt-out request received after
    the
    Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration. If you opt-out of the
    Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms of Use will continue to apply to you, including the
    below
    venue clause specifying Atlanta, Georgia.<br />
    <strong>Survival.</strong> Except as provided in the “Severability” section above, this Dispute Resolution
    Section will survive any
    termination of these Terms of Use and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Jamba Online
    Services or
    terminate your Jamba account, if any.

  <h3 id="governing-law">GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</h3>
  <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia applicable
    to contracts entered into and fully performed in Georgia (without regard to its conflicts of law principles that
    would cause the application of any other jurisdiction’s laws). Judicial proceedings (other than small claims
    actions) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement set forth above must be brought in state or federal court
    in Atlanta, Georgia, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal
    jurisdiction in Atlanta, Georgia. </p>

  <h3 id="miscellaneous">MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
  <p><strong>Interpreting these Terms of Use.</strong> Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms,
    conditions, policies,
    guidelines, standards, and in-product disclosures, these Terms of Use (including those items incorporated by
    reference) constitute the entire agreement between Jamba and you pertaining to your access to or use of the
    Jamba
    Online Services and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Jamba
    and
    you.
    These Terms of Use do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon anyone other than you
    and
    Jamba. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, except as otherwise
    indicated
    in the “No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings” section above, such provision will be struck and
    will
    not
    affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Where the word “will” is used in these
    Terms
    of
    Use it connotes an obligation with the same meaning as “shall.”<br />
    <strong>No Waiver.</strong> Jamba’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Use will not
    constitute a waiver of
    such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in
    these
    Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without
    prejudice
    to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise permitted under law.<br />
    <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement of the parties with
    respect to the subject
    matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between the parties
    with
    respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms of Use may not be amended, nor any obligation waived,
    except
    by
    Jamba, or with Jamba’s prior written authorization. Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of
    Use
    shall
    not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> You acknowledge that any breach of this agreement would cause Jamba
    irreparable injury, such that
    Jamba would have no adequate remedy at law. You agree that in the event of such breach, Jamba shall be
    entitled
    to
    injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or equity, without the requirement of
    posting
    a bond.</p>

          SPV
          LLC,
          and/or its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and licensees (collectively,
          “<strong>Jamba</strong>”). The Program provides
          eligible Jamba account holders who register for the Program through <a href="index.html">www.jamba.com</a> (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) or the App
          (“<strong>Members</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) with the opportunity to earn
          “<strong>Points</strong>” by participating in various activities, some of
          which are described below. You can redeem your Points from time to time for various
          “<strong>Rewards</strong>” as set forth
          below. These Jamba Rewards Terms govern the Program along with any other terms or policies
          incorporated by
          reference into these Jamba Rewards Terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
          these Jamba

          prevail, govern and control with respect to any matters pertaining to the Program and the other

          will prevail, govern and control with respect to all other matters. Please read these Jamba
          Rewards

          you

          for
          the
          Program
          through the Website or App. Minors must have parental consent. Registration is free. Any
          person
          whose
          access
          to the Website or App has been terminated or suspended by Jamba is NOT eligible to
          participate.
          To

          these
          Jamba
          Rewards
          Terms. Once you complete and submit all the registration information, a Program account
          (each,
          an
          “<strong>Account</strong>”)
          will be created for you. All registration information must be completed in full. Memberships
          can
          only be
          used by the Member whose name is listed on the Account. You should not give your password to
          any
          other
          person. You are responsible for all activity in your Account and any use of your password.
          Limit
          one (1)
          Account per person. You cannot have more than one Account. Jamba may, at any time, require
          you
          to verify
          your name and address by means of faxing, emailing, or mailing to Jamba a copy of your
          driver’s
          license
          or
          other form of identification approved by Jamba, in addition to providing Jamba with a signed
          statement
          of
          legitimacy; and Jamba may automatically require such verification in the case of multiple
          accounts from
          the
          same address, household, computer or IP address. If you attempt to obtain more than one
          Account,
          all
          Points
          in your Account may be forfeited, and Jamba may, at its sole discretion, terminate your
          membership and
          permanently ban you from participating in the Program. Officers, directors and employees of
          Jamba and
          its
          parent, subsidiaries, divisions and affiliates, (each, a “<strong>Program Entity</strong>,”
          and
          collectively, the
          “<strong>Program Entities</strong>”) may participate in the Program but may not be allowed to
          redeem Points for certain Rewards
          and
          may otherwise be subject to restrictions that do not generally apply to how Points are
          earned or
          used.
          Additional or different eligibility criteria may apply to certain opportunities to earn or
          use
          Points
          and
          other invitations made by the Program Entities or their business partners. The Program is
          provided to
          individuals only. Corporations, associations, or other groups may not participate in the
          Program. It
          will be
          considered fraudulent for any individual, company, club, association or group to use or to
          direct,
          encourage, or allow other persons to use a single Account for the purpose of accumulating or
          aggregating
          Points for combined use, unless such use is expressly permitted by Jamba. Participation in
          the
          Program
          constitutes each Member’s permission for the Program Entities to use the Member’s first and
          last
          name,
          username, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements, address (city

          description of any Rewards won and any other personal characteristics for advertising and/or
          publicity
          purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in
          perpetuity,

          request
          that we delete your Account. If you delete your Account this means you will lose any Points,

        <p id="earning-points"><strong>Earning Points and Rewards.</strong></p>

        <p> Members have many ways to earn Points and Rewards in the Program.
          The Program may also award
          more than
          one
          type or “class” of Points. The number of Points and the type or “class” of Points that can
          be
          earned by
          participating in any opportunity to earn Points will be disclosed when the opportunity is
          presented.
          Some of
          the ways Members can earn Points and Rewards may include the following (subject to change):
        </p>

        <p><strong>Purchasing Jamba Products at Participating Locations</strong> <br />
          You can earn Points by visiting participating Jamba retail stores in the United States and purchasing Jamba

          retail stores in the United States on dine-in, carry-out, delivery, or catering pick-up (excluding the
          purchase of gift cards or fundraising cards)). You cannot earn points on orders placed through third-party
          delivery providers, such as UberEats or DoorDash. To earn Points for retail store purchases, enter the phone
          number associated with your Account at the time of purchase or for purchases on the Website or the App login
          to your Account. Limit one (1) phone number per transaction (if applicable). You will receive one (1) “Point”
          for each U.S. dollar spent, except during limited time promotions when Jamba may offer “Bonus Points” on
          featured products and/or services. No partial Points will be earned for purchase amounts less than one (1)
          U.S. dollar.

          birthday of record that was provided to Jamba during the Account set-up
          (“<strong>Birthday
            Reward</strong>”). Once
          your
          birthday is set in your Account profile, it cannot be changed. To receive a Birthday
          Reward,
          you
          must
          have an Account at least two (2) days before your birthday and meet certain minimum
          Points

          <strong>BOGO Fundraising Rewards</strong> <br />
          The Program might provide Members with the opportunity to redeem a certain number of

        <p id="points-rewards"><strong>POINTS AND REWARDS REDEMPTION.</strong></p>

        <p> Members may redeem Points for products, discounts, coupons, merchandise, and other rewards as determined by
          Jamba in its sole discretion (each, a “<strong>Reward</strong>”). Rewards may expire if not used by a date
          specified by Jamba,
          further details are provided on the Website or App on a reward-specific basis. A service fee of $0.35 and
          sales tax will be charged on each Reward redemption for orders placed via the Website or App. In-store
          redemption of a Reward is not subject to the service fee, but sales or other local tax may be imposed as
          required by law. You may view your current earned Points or earned Rewards and their expiration date by
          logging into your Account. Jamba, in its sole discretion, may impose a limit on the number of Points or
          Rewards in the aggregate or by type that may earned or redeemed per Account, per day, per Reward or per any
          other generally applicable metric that may be selected by Jamba from time to time in its sole discretion.
          Points are not valid on the same transaction that earned the Points and are valid on the next store visit only
          as determined by Jamba in its sole discretion. </p>
        <p> Rewards are subject to availability as determined by Jamba in its sole discretion. The expiration date for a
          Reward, if any, will be disclosed when the Reward is presented and may vary for different categories of
          Rewards. Jamba reserves the right to modify, amend or revise the Rewards available. Members may not rely on
          continued Reward availability. The number of Points required to redeem any Reward may be substantially
          increased, any Reward may be withdrawn, and restrictions and other terms and conditions associated with any
          Reward or its redemption may be imposed by Jamba or its designee or the third party business partner supplying
          the Reward. Rewards are non-assignable and non-transferable and may not be bartered or sold. Any Rewards
          assigned, transferred, bartered, or sold in violation of these Jamba Rewards Terms may be confiscated or
          cancelled. Physical Rewards (if any) will be shipped only to the United States address currently on file with
          Jamba for the applicable Member’s Account and will not be shipped to any other person or address. A pattern of
          redeeming Points for Rewards preceded or followed by changing the address, email address or telephone number
          for the applicable Account may be viewed as redemption fraud and could result in the termination of your
          membership in the Program. Jamba reserves the right to substitute Rewards of comparable or greater value if
          any redeemed Reward becomes unavailable for any reason. Unless otherwise specified at the time of redemption,
          physical Rewards (if any) will be fulfilled within six to eight weeks from date of redemption. Rewards
          pictured in point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Program
          materials are for illustrative purposes only. The actual Reward may vary from the Reward pictured. </p>
        <p> All details and restrictions of the Rewards not specified at the time the redemption opportunity is
          presented will be determined by Jamba in its sole discretion. Members shall be solely responsible for all
          federal, state, and/or local taxes including, without limitation, income taxes and any reporting consequences
          thereof in connection with a Reward. If required by law, as determined by Jamba in its sole discretion, Jamba
          reserves the right to withhold and remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the amount of any taxes due.
        </p>
        <p>Points and Rewards have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash and may not be sold,
          auctioned,
          bartered, brokered, purchased, transferred, assigned, or used to engage in any gambling
          activity. Any
          Points
          or Rewards obtained in this manner by any person or entity will be considered to have been
          fraudulently
          obtained and deemed void and such Points and Rewards may be confiscated or cancelled. Points
          and
          Rewards
          must be redeemed in accordance with these Jamba Rewards Terms. Points and Rewards will not
          be
          replaced,
          reissued, or credited if lost, stolen, or otherwise altered or destroyed. If the Program
          includes tiers
          that
          provide the Member with benefits based on meeting a stated minimum threshold number of
          Points
          (each such
          tier, if any, referred to as “<strong>Points Level</strong>”), you should know that Points
          Levels are subject to change.
          Jamba, in its sole discretion and without notice to you, reserves the right to change,
          modify,
          withdraw,
          or
          cancel any Points Level. Jamba also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine
          and
          modify,
          at
          any time, the value of Points and the number of Points or the type of Reward that may be
          earned
          for any
          given activity.Rewards cannot be used in combination with any other discount,
          coupon
          or
          offer
          unless specifically allowed by the terms of a specific promotion. Once you have redeemed
          your
          Points or
          Rewards, they are gone and there are no refunds, returns or exchanges for additional Points,
          Rewards,
          cash,
          or other goods and services, even if you return the products, merchandise or other item(s)
          that
          your
          Points
          or Rewards were redeemed toward.</p>

        <p id="modification-termination"><strong>MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION.</strong></p>

        <p>Jamba may modify any of these Jamba Rewards Terms, including, but not limited to, the
          methods
          through
          which
          Points or Rewards can be earned, how Points or Rewards can be used, the types or “classes”
          of
          Points
          available, and the conditions under which Points or Rewards may expire or be forfeited, at
          any
          time,
          with or
          without notice, even though these changes may affect a Member's ability to use the Points or
          Rewards
          that
          the Member has already earned. The Program has no predetermined termination date and may
          continue until
          such
          time as Jamba decides to terminate the Program. Jamba may, in its sole discretion, modify or
          terminate
          the
          Program, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason or no reason at all, with
          notice on
          the
          Website, in the App and/or via email to the Member’s email address currently on file with
          Jamba
          for
          their
          Account.</p>
        <p>If Jamba amends these Jamba Rewards Terms, it will revise the “last updated” date located at
          the
          top of
          these Jamba Rewards Terms. For changes to these Jamba Rewards Terms that Jamba considers to
          be
          material,
          Jamba may place a notice in the App or Website by revising the link on the home page to read
          substantially
          as “Updated My Jamba Rewards Terms and Conditions” for an amount of time that we determine
          in
          our
          discretion. If you continue to participate in the Program by earning Points or Rewards,
          redeeming Points
          or
          Rewards, logging onto your Account or in any other way after these Jamba Rewards Terms have
          been
          changed,
          you will be deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally consented to and agreed to
          such
          changes.
          The
          most current version of these Jamba Rewards Terms will be available on the Website and will
          supersede
          all
          previous versions of these Jamba Rewards Terms.</p>
        <p>If Jamba decides in its sole discretion to discontinue the Program, Members will have
          approximately
          thirty
          (30) days or an amount of time deemed reasonable by Jamba in its sole discretion from the
          date
          Program
          termination is announced to use their remaining Points or Rewards. Use of any remaining
          Points
          or
          Rewards
          will be on a first come, first serve basis and otherwise subject to the availability of
          Rewards.
          Members
          may
          not rely on continued Points or Reward availability. Jamba makes no representation or
          warranty
          about the
          number or type of Rewards that may be available after Program termination has been
          announced,
          and many
          Rewards that may have been available prior to termination will quickly become depleted or
          otherwise
          unavailable once the Program termination has been announce. Any Points or Rewards remaining
          in a
          Member's
          Account at the time of termination will be forfeited and no compensation will be provided.
          Jamba
          may
          cancel
          your membership, cancel accumulated Points or Rewards, alter the number of Points or Rewards
          in
          your
          Account
          or suspend your membership privileges at any time with immediate effect if Jamba determines
          in
          its sole
          discretion that you (a) have acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws or
          ordinances;
          (b)
          acted in
          a fraudulent or abusive manner; (c) breached any of these Jamba Rewards Terms; (d) engaged
          in
          any fraud
          or
          abuse concerning Points or Rewards, Points/Rewards usage or Points/Rewards redemption; or
          (e)
          engaged in
          any
          conduct or act that causes Jamba to terminate or suspend your access to your Account. Jamba
          may
          also
          take
          appropriate administrative or legal action if any of the items listed above occurs. Nothing
          contained in
          these Jamba Rewards Terms shall limit Jamba in its exercise of any legal or equitable rights
          or
          remedies.
        </p>
        <p>Jamba reserves the right to terminate the membership of any Member whose Account becomes
          dormant. An
          Account
          will be considered dormant if the Account holder fails to log onto his or her Account for
          twelve
          (12)
          months
          or with such regularity deemed sufficient by Jamba and announced from time to time on the
          Website. Jamba
          in
          its sole discretion may allow Members to prevent their Points from expiring by following
          Jamba's
          instructions.</p>

        <p>ACCRUED POINTS AND REWARDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE PROPERTY OF A MEMBER AND HAVE NO VALUE OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM.
          POINTS AND REWARDS ARE CREDITS THAT JAMBA MAY REVOKE AT ANY TIME AS SET FORTH HEREIN. POINTS AND REWARDS ARE
          NOT TRANSFERABLE UPON DEATH, AS PART OF A DOMESTIC RELATIONS MATTER OR OTHERWISE. Each Member is responsible
          for ensuring that the information in the Member’s Account is accurate and is kept current. If a Member
          believes that the Member’s Account does not properly reflect Points or Rewards earned from engaging in any
          activities, the Member must contact Jamba to resolve the issue. Any attempt by any person to undermine the
          legitimate operation of the Program may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt
          be made, Jamba reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.
          Jamba's failure to enforce any of these Jamba Rewards Terms shall not constitute a waiver of the affected
          provision, or any other provision. All questions or disputes regarding an individual’s eligibility for the

          ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; THEREFORE, SUCH EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
          APPLY TO YOU. IF A MEMBER PROVES THAT JAMBA HAS IMPROPERLY DENIED THAT MEMBER ANY POINTS OR REWARDS, LIABILITY
